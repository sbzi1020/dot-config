* Helpful settings

=Helpful= is a replacement for *help* buffers that provides much more contextual information.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helpful
    :defer t
      ;;
      ;; 'counsel' related configuration
      ;;
      ;; :init
      ;; (setq counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
      ;; (setq counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
      ;; :bind
      ;; ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
      ;; ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
      ;; ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
      ;; ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key)
  )
#+END_SRC
