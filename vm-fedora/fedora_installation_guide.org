*  Fedora Installation Guide

** Download the =Everything= net install ISO

X86_64 - https://alt.fedoraproject.org/
AARCH64 - https://alt.fedoraproject.org/alt/


** Graphical install process

The GUI install process is pretty easy, just follow this [[https://able.bio/KY64/minimal-installation-fedora-linux--73410e6d][page]] to walk through all steps.

The things I need to change are below:

*** No default =/home= partion

=Installation Destination= -> =Custom= -> Change the partion type to =Standard partion= and then =Click here to create them automatic= -> remove the =/home/= mount point (press =-= to remove it) and add its space to the =/= partion!!!


After that, the partions should look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sda
   |-- sda1  600M EFI  /boot/efi
   |-- sda2  1G   ext4 /boot
   |-- sda3  62G  ext  /
#+END_SRC


*** Only install =Minimal Install=

=Software Selection= -> =Minimal Install=


*** Root password


*** User creation


**  Configuration

*** Make sure the system is up-to-date after first login

Add =max_parallel_downloads=10= to ~=/etc/dnf/dnf.conf~ and then:
 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo dnf check-update

  # If `dnf check-update` say you got something to update
  sudo dnf update
#+END_SRC


*** Install everything I need

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo dnf install git bat ripgrep procs htop btop neofecth fzf fish neovim emacs alacritty tmux hyprland dunst qt6-qtwayland wl-clipboard waybar pavucontrol mpv cava dbus dbus-daemon
#+END_SRC


Change default shell to =fish=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
#+END_SRC


*** How to fix =ip= command not found

Install =iproute= if you didn't yet (the =Minimal Install= should install it already, but the =/sbin/= doesn't include to your =$PATH= yet)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo dnf install iproute
#+END_SRC


*** Install C Development tools

You have to install =C Development Tools and Libraries= before restoring =neovim= configuration to =~/.config/nvim=, as it requires the =cc= compiler:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries"

  #
  # If you need llvm and clang, `clangd` is inside `clang-tools-extra`
  #
  sudo dnf install llvm clang clang-tools-extra
#+END_SRC


*** Install =Rust= as =swww= doesn't exists in =Fedora=

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
#+END_SRC

Then relogin to take effects.


*** Configure git and restore my dot files


*** Install nerd fonts

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Install the basic font without nerd font icon support
  sudo dnf install jetbrains-mono-fonts-all

  # Install nerd font version
  cd temp
  curl -OL https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/JetBrainsMono.tar.xz
  tar xvf JetBrainsMono.tar.xz
  rm -rf  JetBrainsMono.tar.xz

  # Update font cache
  sudo mkdir /usr/share/fonts/jetbrains-mono-nerd-fonts
  sudo fc-cache -fv
  fc-cache -fv
#+END_SRC


*** Install =brave= 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
  sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://brave-browser-rpm-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser.repo
  sudo rpm --import https://brave-browser-rpm-release.s3.brave.com/brave-core.asc
  sudo dnf install brave-browser
#+END_SRC


**** How to launch

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  dbus-run-session brave-browser > ~/.launch_brave_browser.log

  #
  # If you want all fonts are bigger, change `GDK_DPI_SCALE` to your value
  #
  GDK_DPI_SCALE=1.2 dbus-run-session brave-browser > ~/.launch_brave_browser.log
#+END_SRC


**** Enable =wayland=

Open =brave://flags= in URL bar, then search =zone=, you should be able to see the =Preferred Ozone platform= option, set it to ~Wayland~ and re-launch to take affects.
